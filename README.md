## RARE HHS Dashboard for Socioeconomic Data Visualization

### Tool Objective
This tool summarizes information collected through the Fish Forever Household Survey (HHS). The HHS contains defined-answer questions assessing respondentsâ€™ livelihoods, engagement with the local fishery, resilience to economic shocks, social capital, knowledge of fishing regulations, attitudes towards and participation in fisheries management, and perceptions of current management approaches.

### Metadata
Here is a the metadata associated with the HHS dataset. Please refer to the [HHS Guidance document](https://portal.rare.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HHS-Instrument_updated_011221.pdf) for the survey questions and specific answers. Each HHS question starts with a number (1 to 83). Other columns are information regarding administration levels, management levels, date of survey, submission ids, etc. Seven questions (Q7, Q14, Q15, Q44, Q45, Q48, and Q69) have multiple choice answers and appear at the end of the dataset.
