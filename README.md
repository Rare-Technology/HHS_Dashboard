## RARE HHS Dashboard for Socioeconomic Data Visualization

This tool summarizes information collected through the Fish Forever Household Survey (HHS). The HHS contains defined-answer questions assessing respondentsâ€™ livelihoods, engagement with the local fishery, resilience to economic shocks, social capital, knowledge of fishing regulations, attitudes toward fisheries management, participation in fisheries management, and perceptions of current management approaches.

Here is a the metadata associated with the dataset. Please refer to the [HHS Guidance document](https://portal.rare.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HHS-Instrument_updated_011221.pdf) for the Survey questions and answers. Each HHS question starts with a number (1 to 83).  The rest of the columns are information regarding administration levels, management levels, date of survey, submission ids, etc. The data is divided in **eight data files** depending on the type of questions asked. These data files can be joined together by a unique *submissionid* for analysis.


The data files are:       
*hhs_surveys* - Most questions         
*hhs_people* - Q7     
*hhs_responsabilities* - Q14      
*hhs_activities* - Q15      
*hhs_meeting* - Q44     
*hhs_leadership* - Q45      
*hhs_enforcement* - Q48        
*hhs_customers* - Q69
