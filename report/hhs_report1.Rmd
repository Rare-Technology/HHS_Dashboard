# SUMMARY

\newpage
# INTRODUCTION

Fish Forever is a community focused approach that uses a scientifically informed, community-driven process to design areas of managed access with reserves (MA+R) for multi-species coastal fisheries in developing nations. The aim of Fish Forever is to enable the effective management of coastal fisheries in an ecosystem and socio-economic context. That is, the protection of the environment and the sustainable use of natural assets are linked directly to building a resilient local economy underpinning the well-being and long-term prosperity of coastal communities. 

The Fish Forever strategy is based on three program pillars that link crucial activities on community-based management, policy and governance, and blended finance, all connected by a tenet of behavior adoption. The three pillars provide a guiding framework and are used to structure program implementation across fishing communities. Eight key work areas or program elements are used to organize and deliver the program (Fig. 1). Two cross-cutting work areas (Gender Mainstreaming and Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change) inform delivery strategies across the eight core program elements.

**Figure 1**: Fish Forever eight program elements

This program strategy supports an approach that is efficient, effective, scalable, and replicable to assess and solve the problems associated with overexploitation of coastal fisheries. The ultimate goals of Fish Forever are to sustain livelihoods, alleviate poverty, secure food supply, and conserve marine biodiversity for the coastal communities that rely on local fisheries. To achieve these socio-economic and ecological goals, the Fish Forever strategy relies on a results-based framework with key indicators of success that are monitored and evaluated throughout the program. The global monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan measures outcomes and impacts of program activities. Outcome indicators assess the results from achieving program milestones through specific activities. Impact indicators track progress towards the broader Fish Forever goals and the cumulative effects of all program activities. 

Socio-economic outcomes in communities receiving the Fish Forever interventions were measured through results of interviews conducted using a standardized household survey (HHS). Table 1 and Table 2 outline the outcome and impact metrics used to assess and evaluate socioeconomic indicators of program implementation that are measured through the household survey. This report summarizes findings from a first round of household surveys conducted from `r min(as.Date(selectedData()$updatedat))` to `r max(as.Date(selectedData()$updatedat))` in `r length(unique(selectedData()$level4_id))` communities associated with `r length(unique(selectedData()$ma_name))` proposed managed access areas across `r length(unique(selectedData()$level1_name))` provinces in `r unique(selectedData()$country)`.

The results of the household surveys are used to evaluate the socioeconomic outcomes and impacts of the Fish Forever program implementation in these communities. Program activities associated with three of the Fish Forever’s eight program elements (i.e., Community Engagement and Behavior Adoption, Effective Management Bodies, and Managed Access) have been implemented since ....

# METHODOLGY

Household surveys were conducted in `r length(unique(selectedData()$level4_id))` communities associated with `r length(unique(selectedData()$ma_name))` managed access areas throughout `r length(unique(selectedData()$level1_name))` provinces in `r unique(selectedData()$country)` (Fig. 2). Socio-economic indicators were assessed across each managed access area where the number of households interviewed ranged from `r min(summary(selectedData()$ma_name))` to `r max(summary(selectedData()$ma_name))`. For each managed access area, surveys were distributed proportionally among Fish Forever's targeted communities based on estimated population numbers of each community.

The household survey has 80 core questions covering several topics that included: basic information, livelihood, fishing and related activities, household assets, financial resilience, social capital, fishery management, enforcement and compliance, food security, attitudes, and expenditures and income. Not all questions are responded by all interviewees because several are specifically tailored to fisher households, and other questions are tailored to communities with managed access areas, fishery management regulations, and/or management bodies. As such, the total number questions answer by interviewees varied across communities and proposed managed access areas.

Households were randomly selected from a complete list of all the households in the community. Ideally household surveys should obtain information from both men and women distributed proportionally in the community. However, this was not possible because in many cases cultural barriers did not allow women to represent or speak on behalf of the household. As such there was a bias in the data towards male respondents, with higher number of male than females interviewed (Table 3). We are exploring strategies to collect more sex balanced data through other methods in the future.

For detailed information about the methodology used in conducting household surveys please refer to the [Global Household Survey Instrument](https://portal.rare.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HHS-Instrument_V2_62719.pdf).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Our results showed that communities associated with managed access areas where Fish Forever’s program activities have been implemented are associated with higher socio-economic indicator values. ...

*Each country team should briefly describe and discuss each result from the tables and figures below based on local and regional knowledge, experience or scientific literature.*

## Impact Indicators

### I.	Goal: Improve Well-Being

The socio-economic baseline for well-being from fishing activities was assessed (Table 23)...

The perceptions of well-being improvement across communities depend on many interacting factors. Improve in well-being may be a reflection of localized catch declines, compliance with fisheries regulations, the current stage and function of community-based management, and/or government fisheries management bodies.

# CONCLUSIONS

Fishing is an important livelihood activity in the studied villages associated with proposed managed access areas across SE Sulawesi. The baseline of the analyzed Fish Forever program pillars indicates that there are several challenges:

  1.. 
  2..
  3..
  
The goal of the Fish Forever interventions at the early stage of implementation will enable the effective management of coastal fisheries in an ecosystem and socio-economic context. That is, the protection of the environment and the sustainable use of natural assets will be linked to building a resilient local economy underpinning the well-being and long-term prosperity of coastal communities. These results will be used as baseline to assess program success.
